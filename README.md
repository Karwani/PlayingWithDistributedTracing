# Playing with Distributed Tracing

This is a small .NET Core demo application to try out distributed tracing using `Jaeger` and `OpenTracing`.

[Separate branch](https://github.com/19balazs86/PlayingWithDistributedTracing/tree/netcoreapp2.2) with the .NET Core 2.2 version.

##### What is distributed tracing
> Distributed tracing is a method used to profile and monitor applications, especially those built using a microservices architecture. Distributed tracing helps pinpoint where failures occur and what causes poor performance.

The solution contains 3 projects.

##### Common
- Tracer initializer.
- Some extension methods for `ITracer`, `ISpan` in order to make the life easier.

##### WebApp
- HelloController: The action returns with a random response (200, 400, 500...) to simulate real life cases (good or bad response).

##### ClientApp
- Console application.
- Initiate HTTP calls to the WebApp.
- Inject the tracing information in to the HTTP header.
- Using [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly) to retry and cancel the call.
